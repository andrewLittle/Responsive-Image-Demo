I tl;dr; the piece I was origially writing. This is my solution for responsive images. This is a very specific solution to our problem and not a "silver bullet". This is more of a "you could do it this way" post. Hopefully I will cover my path to get here with a blog post. I did look at other solutions, before implimenting this one. If the images I used for examples are your's and you want them removed, please let me know.
